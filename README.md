# Age-Prediction-CNN
This project aims to create a deep learning model using the ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to accurately predict a person's age from an image of their face. The model is designed to handle complex image recognition tasks and has been trained on a labeled dataset to provide precise predictions.
